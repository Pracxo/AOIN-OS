# Shadow Activation Security Review

AION-181 implements the AION-180-authorized disabled controlled shadow activation control plane.
It validates candidates, requests, externally supplied approval evidence, resource budgets, local redacted evidence bundles, monitoring snapshots, deactivation decisions, incident records, audit evidence, provenance evidence, operator review items, and simulation-only outcomes.

The control plane can validate and simulate future activation requests but cannot activate shadow mode. Shadow activation remains false, shadow-mode runtime remains false, actual activation remains unavailable, and every decision remains evidence only.

AION-180-SI-0007 remains active pending AION-182 closeout. AION-182 is the next formal closeout and operator-evaluation task. Actual activation requires another authorization after AION-182.
